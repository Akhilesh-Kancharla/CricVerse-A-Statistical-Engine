# CricVerse ‚Äî Beyond the Scorecard
A focused cricket analytics engine that converts raw match YAML files into a Pressure Resistance Model (PRM) and a small Flask UI to explore player, PRS and venue summaries.

Overview
- Purpose: Process ball-by-ball match YAML files, compute pressure-aware scores (PRS), and expose results via CLI reports and a Flask web UI.
- Data: Raw YAML match files are expected in Data/Matches (the data directory is not included here).
- Database: SQLite (database.db) used by multiple modules and by the Flask app.

## Notes:
- The tree above lists files that exist and those the code references. If match_parser.py or delivery_scorer.py are missing, the pipeline will raise ImportError; create stubs or implement them.
- database.db is generated at runtime; include a migration or data processing script (process_data.py) in the pipeline to populate DB if needed.

Quickstart ‚Äî install & run (minimal)
1. Create & activate Python venv (recommended)
   - python3 -m venv venv
   - source venv/bin/activate

2. Install requirements
   - If requirements.txt exists: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Otherwise install minimal packages:
     pip install flask pyyaml sqlite3

3. Prepare data & DB
- Place YAML match files under Data/Matches (the analyzer expects this path).
- The project expects a SQLite DB 'database.db'. If missing, scripts like player_master.py will create/populate some tables; implement or run the data ingestion pipeline to populate full schema.

4. Run the Flask web app (local)
   - python main.py
   - The app opens at http://127.0.0.1:5000 (main.py tries to open a browser automatically).

5. Run PRS CLI (process YAML -> compute PRS)
   - python prm.py
   - prm.py processes files under Data/Matches and invokes Package.cricket_analyzer.CricketAnalyzer which:
     - Parses matches (MatchParser)
     - Classifies pressure per delivery (PressureClassifier)
     - Scores deliveries (DeliveryScorer)
     - Aggregates scores (PRSCalculator)
     - Formats/outputs results (ResultsFormatter)

**Notes on installation**
- Use Python 3.9+.
- If you use the repo inside containers/CI, ensure the process has read access to Data/Matches and write access to create database.db.
- If a requirements.txt is missing, add the packages you actually used in your environment.

**Web app & API** (endpoints present in main.py)
- GET /                 -> index page (templates expected under templates/)
- GET /player-report    -> player search page
- GET /player_dashboard -> player dashboard page
- GET /api/player_data/<name>
  - Returns aggregated player data (batting, bowling, per-season stats, performance snapshot)
  - Expects DB tables: players_master, players, batsman_stats, bowling_stats, master_match
- GET /prm-report       -> PRM explorer page
- GET /api/prm_data
  - Returns PRM rows from the prm table (player_name, batting_prs, bowling_prs, bat_balls, bowl_balls)
  - Supports search query parameter ?search=xxx
- GET /venue-report and GET /report?venue=XXX
  - Venue dashboard using master_match and related stats

### Key modules ‚Äî short descriptions & usage
- Package/pressure_classifier.py
  - Classifies a delivery into pressure levels (VERY_LOW..EXTREME) and returns a numeric weight used when aggregating PRS.
- Package/prs_calculator.py
  - Maintains per-player lists of delivery-level scores and pressure weights and produces final PRS (normalized).
- Package/results_formater.py
  - Prints results (table, detailed, json) and writes a prm table into database.db. It ensures prm table exists and performs inserts. Be aware of types (integers/floats) when viewing DB.
- Package/cricket_analyzer.py
  - High-level orchestrator: loads YAML match, iterates innings and deliveries, calls classifier and scorer, pushes deliveries to calculator, then finalizes and formats results.
- prm.py
  - Simple CLI wrapper that finds YAML files under Data/Matches and calls CricketAnalyzer to process them.
- player_master.py
  - Creates players_master table and imports Data/names.csv ‚Äî useful to create a canonical name mapping used by the web app.

### Database & schema notes
- The Flask app and scripts expect SQLite tables:
  - players (fullname, firstname, lastname, bowlingstyle, image_path, ...)
  - players_master (identifier, name) ‚Äî mapping from canonical id -> available names
  - batsman_stats (player_id, match_id, runs, no_of_balls, dismissal_kind, ...)
  - bowling_stats (player_id, match_id, wickets, runs_given, balls_played, ...)
  - master_match (match_id, date, venue, team_1_score, team_2_score, toss_winner, toss_desicion, winner, ...)
  - prm (player_name, batting_prs, bowling_prs, bat_balls, bowl_balls) ‚Äî created by ResultsFormatter if missing
- If any of these tables are missing, you will get OperationalError. Use the provided data-processing scripts (if available) to populate DB.

### Troubleshooting ‚Äî common issues & fixes
- "No YAML files found": ensure Data/Matches exists and contains .yaml/.yml files; prm.py currently defaults path to "Data/Matches".
- "no such table: prm": ResultsFormatter auto-creates the prm table when inserting results; if insert fails, inspect database permissions.
- Player not found from API: run player_master.py to populate players_master (needs Data/names.csv), or verify players table fullnames match players_master.name.
- Database concurrency: main.py uses Flask app context and per-request DB connections via flask.g. Avoid long-lived global connections.

**Developer notes**
- Add tests under Package/tests/ and run with pytest.
- To extend scoring rules, modify Package/delivery_scorer.py (scorer is used by cricket_analyzer).
- To change normalization or weighting, update Package/prs_calculator.py.
- The static/js/prm_react_dom.js file is a bundled script; modify source React code (if available) rather than editing the bundle.

### Suggested maintenance tasks
- Add a requirements.txt with exact pinned versions (Flask, PyYAML, pandas/numpy if used).
- Add a small process_data.py or document the pipeline to build the SQLite DB from YAML.
- Add a templates/ directory and list the pages expected by the Flask app.
- Add tests that validate PRS outputs on a small subset of YAML files.

### Contributing
- Fork, create a feature branch, add tests, open a PR with details.
- For large changes, open an issue first to discuss approach.

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Application
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection Errors**
   ```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
 - Interactive Data Visualizations: Integrate Chart.js or D3.js for dynamic graphs.
 - Live Match Integration: Pull live scores via an API and overlay predictive analytics in real-time.
 - AI-Powered Projections: Use machine learning to predict player form and match winners.
 - Advanced Interactive Filters: Add client-side, JS-based sorting and filtering for all data tables.
 - PDF/Report Exports: Allow users to download strategic match previews and player reports.
